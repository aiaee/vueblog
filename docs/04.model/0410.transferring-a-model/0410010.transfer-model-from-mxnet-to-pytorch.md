### How the MxNet model transfer to Pytorch

* Windows environment configuration,
* Save MXNet models,
* Transfer the model into pytorch,
* Verification result

<!-- more -->

#### 0. Windows environment configuration
> Install CUDA10.2\
> Use miniconda3 cteate environment with python3.6\
> Install mxnet-cu102-1.7.0\
> Install pytorch-1.7 GPU\
> Model of insightface(https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface)

#### 1. Train and save MXNet models
> 1 Download insightface from github    \
      git clone --recursive https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface.git \
> 2 Download the training dataset from database-zoo(https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/wiki/Dataset-Zoo) \
> 3 Download model from Model-Zoo(https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/wiki/Model-Zoo) \
> 4 Create the dataset folder and put the extracted data set into insightface/recognition/ArcFace/   \
> 5 Copy the configuration file 
> cp sample_config.py config.py  change dataset_dir path\
> 6 According to the number of nvidia graphics cards, select the appropriate command to start training, first set it in the command line. set CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES='0', \
> Change bath_size to 32 and -network r50 \
> Change the default parameter saved by the model to true  \
> 7 Start training

```
python -u train.py \
--network r50  \
--loss arcface \
--dataset emore
```

Save the training model to the path to complete the training and saving of the model.
 
#### 2. Transfer the model into pytorch


#### 3. Verification result
